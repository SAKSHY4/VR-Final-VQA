The project was done solo by a single member. I proceeded with a novel approach of providing the options to the model instead of vanilla prompt tuning to try to confuse the model and make it learn and discriminate (read report for more details).
I did not have time to train a second vanilla model so I could not produce comparisons to my approach.
Due to severe computing limitations of me doing it alone, I could only train a single epoch.

The inference setup follows the exact same template as provided to us on Outlook. Just modify the csv and image path in the script.

Thanks!
